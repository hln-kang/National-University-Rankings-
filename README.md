# airplane_crashes_and_fatalities_since_1908-
The goal of my project is to look at cases of airplane crashes and fatalities since 1908. Specifically, how the number of passengers aboard the flight relate to how many fatalities resulted from the crash. I did not use any API documentation, rather I found and took a public dataset from data.world. This is the link to the dataset: https://data.world/data-society/airplane-crashes. The data was created by @data-society from OpenData. The data types in my dataset are bot categorical and numerical. For example, the operator and the type is categorical, while the passengers aboard and the fatalities are numerical. There are no known issues in this dataset, but I can reasonably assume that whoever recorded the summary of the crash may be biased depending on their position, such as if they were the pilot themselves. I can also assume that not all crashes have been found or recorded to accuracy, so that is a potential issue.
